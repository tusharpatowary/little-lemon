# Little Lemon Restaurant Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Little Lemon Restaurant** website!


## Project Background

Restaurant: Little Lemon  

Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12–15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.



## About This Project

This website is a project that I built to practice and showcase my skills in web development, specifically using HTML and CSS. The website is designed for a fictional family-owned Mediterranean restaurant called Little Lemon, located in Chicago, Illinois.

The main goal of this project was to create a responsive and visually appealing website that provides information about the restaurant's concept, menu, and ambiance. I aimed to enhance my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling while incorporating modern design practices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** The structure and content of the website are built using HTML5, ensuring semantic markup and accessibility.

- **CSS3:** To style the website, I utilized CSS3. This includes layout design, typography, color schemes, and responsive styling to adapt to various screen sizes.

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
